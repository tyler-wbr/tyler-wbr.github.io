    <h1>How Off-Ball Linebackers Have Evolved Since 1999</h1>
  </header>

  <section class="content-block">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Linebackers have long been the centerpiece of NFL defenses, responsible for stopping runs, 
      pressuring quarterbacks, and covering the middle of the field. But over the past 20+ years, 
      their role has slightly changed. With the league becoming faster and more pass-oriented, 
      linebackers are asked to move side-line to side-line while having run stopping and pass covering ability. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This project explores the evolution of off-ball linebackers since 1999. 
      By analyzing trends in defensive stats and impact scores, we can take a look at how the position has changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guiding question: <strong>How has the role of off-ball linebackers evolved over time, 
      and what factors define a high-impact player today?</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Data Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This analysis focuses on off-ball linebackers from 1999 to 2023, using key stats like solo tackles, sacks, 
      and interceptions. We’ll explore trends over time and also highlight the most impactful players.
    </p>

    <h2>Tackling Trends</h2>
    <p>
      Looking at average solo tackles per season, we see that overall numbers are steady.
    </p>
    <p class="insight">
      Insight: Solo tackles are relatively stable throughout the years, being anywhere from 43 to 52. 
      This slight difference doesn't indicate any major differences in play.

    <h2>Sacks & Interceptions: Changing Styles</h2>
    <p>
      By tracking average sacks and interceptions, patterns emerge. 
      Sacks have slowly increased over time, while interceptions have very slowly declined.
    </p>
    <p class="insight">
      Insight: Linebackers are getting to the quarterbacks more often, reflecting defensive coordinators evolving strategies 
      and complex blitz packages involving linebackers. Quarterbacks are throwing less and less interceptions every year, 
      likely contributing to the linebackers’ decrease in interceptions.

    <h2>Measuring Impact: Career vs Seasonal Averages</h2>
    <p>
      Some linebackers perform consistently over long careers, while others peak in rather short spans. 
      To compare, we can look at total career impact versus average per-season performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, we have compiled an impact score, weighting tackles, tackles for loss, interceptions, forced fumbles, 
      and sacks in order to rank players.
    </p>
    <p class="insight">
      Insight: High-impact seasons can make a player memorable, while sustained performance over many years indicates a lasting legacy.

    <h2>What This Means</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Quarterback Improvements:</strong> Despite becoming a more pass-heavy league, linebackers are getting less and less interceptions, pointing towards improved quarterback play and decision-making.</li>
      <li><strong>Position Flexibility:</strong> Linebackers are getting faster and covering more ground, adapting to the evolving demands of their roles. We see this with a slight increase in sacks over the years.</li>
      <li><strong>Career Totals Don’t Tell the Whole Story:</strong> While career totals provide a snapshot, they often overlook a player's per-season performance. A prime example of this is a player like Luke Kuechly. While he doesn’t appear in the career total leaderboard, he is widely regarded as the best linebacker of this time, and the season average impact scores reflect that as he ranks #1.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="insight">
      Insight: Modern linebackers succeed by being versatile and recording high impact plays like interceptions and fumbles that are crucial to their impact.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Versatility is essential:</strong> Modern linebackers must cover receivers, defend the run, and occasionally blitz. Seeing how the numbers change over the next decade will be interesting.</li>
      <li><strong>High-impact plays:</strong> Interceptions, forced fumbles, and sacks highlight game-changing moments that elevate a player.</li>
      <li><strong>Peak performance matters:</strong> Career totals are important, but standout seasons can solidify a player’s reputation. Both consistency and peak performance shape a linebacker’s overall career impact.</li>
    </ul>
